## Configuration and Installation

### Preparation

Developers should prefer the command-line to web installers/updaters for more control and detailed information.

Start in an empty directory which is accessbile from a browser, and have a fresh SQL database ready.

It might be necessary to call a specific PHP interpreter if `php -v` does not meet the required minimum version, e.g.

`/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php`

This might make it necessary to call `composer` with its full path.

Consequently, we must use the full PHP path for `bin/console` as well!

We might also need to increase the defaul memory limit by adding `-d memory_limit=512M`.

We might want to define an alias e.g. 

`alias php82='/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php -d memory_limit=512M'`

### Composer Configuration

Use composer to generate the configuration and install it

`/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php /usr/local/bin/composer create-project shopware/production .`

`/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php /usr/local/bin/composer install`

Verify that `bin/console` is ready to use:

`/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php bin/console` should print available command, but no error message.

Then edit the configuration before proceeding to install Shopware.

### System Configuration

As of Shopware version 6.5.0.0, the described changes should be made in the .env.local file instead of the .env file.
With Shopware 6.4.17.0 the MAILER_DSN variable will be used in this template instead of MAILER_URL.
([Shopware docs: notes to the APP_URL](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/tutorials-and-faq/notes-to-the-APP-URL))
DATABASE_URL example taken from a [forum thread](https://forum.shopware.com/t/nach-db-wechsel-could-not-connect-to-database/102408).
If the database password contains special characters, they must 
[be escaped in the .env file](https://forum.shopware.com/t/datenbank-passwort-in-der-env-richtig-escapen/91906).

The secret `.env` files must be ignored by git to prevent publicly exposing server secrets.

```
# Secrets
.env
.env.local
```

- `.env.local`
  - APP_ENV=prod 
  - APP_URL=https://prelovedshop.de
  - DATABASE_URL=mysql://121409m93862_4:db_pass@localhost:3306/121409m93862_4
  - MAILER_DSN=smtp://localhost:465?encryption=ssl&auth_mode=login&username=&password=

### Shopware 6 System Installation

Command with explicit paths and parameters:

`/usr/local/phpfarm/inst/php-8.2.18/bin/php -d memory_limit=512M bin/console system:install --basic-setup`

Short version:

`bin/console system:install --basic-setup`

This installs Shopware and creates a default sales channel with Shopware's default Administration credentials
(admin:shopware). Change these credentials after finishing the installation.
